# ngBoilerplate
<h1>ngBoilerplate</h1>
<hr/>
This is the boilerplate template I use when creating an AngularJS project. It tries to follow the below guidelines and best practices for code as well as directory structure for larger scale apps.

Feel free to fork and let me know what you think. This is by no means the be all and end all of boilerplate templates so suggestions and criticism are always welcome.
